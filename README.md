###Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to create a platform for users to view, save, edit and delete information from their own user profile.
The information will be in the form of pictures and exerpts created by Nasa. The goal will be to call data from APIs that Nasa runs
to then allow users to save that data to their own profile or rather API. The user will be able to make edits to the excerpts and/or
delete that saved data from their profile.

###Features:

As a user, I want to be able to save the data that I like because I want to be able to parse through it again without having to hunt for it.
    ####Tasks:
    -Store user saved data
    -Display Data
    -Sort Data

As a user, I would like to edit those excerpts because I want to add my own ideas or feelings regarding that image.
    ####Tasks:
    -Edit Data

As a user, I would want to have the option to remove previous images and data because I no longer need or want it in my profile.
    ####Tasks:
    -Delete Data

###Data Model

The beginning data needed for this app will be:

    Users
    User Profiles
    Dates
    Multiple APIs(APOD, NeoWs and Mars Rover to name a few)
    
###Schedule

The first week will be setting up the user creation, user interface for their profile and data. This week will also likely involve
creating the first link to the API for APOD to give us the ability to see that everything is working. 

The second week will be adding features like saving, deleting and editing to the user interface. The creation of an internal saving system be that an API or file
will likely involve some additional planning and debate.

The third week will be adding other APIs to the base model to allow for a broader user experience with the APIs that Nasa has to offer.

This will keep our project ready for use at the end of each week with the new designs ready to go.
